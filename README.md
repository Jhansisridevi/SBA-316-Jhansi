# Trivia Game
## Description
The Trivia Game is a single page web application that allows users to test their knowledge with a series of multiple-choice questions. Users can select answers, and the game provides feedback on whether their answers are correct or not. The game keeps track of the user's score and provides a final score at the end.
Itâ€™s about finding words(Anagrams) which make sense in a sentence from a selection of jumbled letters.
Anagrams are words which have had their letters scrambled and you have to find the original word.
Here are some examples:

OWLS is an anagram of SLOW
RACE is an anagram of CARE
